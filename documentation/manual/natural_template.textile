h1. Natural Template

p(note). This is *NOT* a Play specific feature.

Rythm (starts from v1.0-b4) provides an new feature called natural template. According to "wikipedia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_engine_(web), an natural template is _the template can be a document as valid as the final result, the engine syntax doesn't break the document's structure_

Here is an example of a Rythm natural template:

bc. <!-- @args String name, int age -->
<p>Hi @name, happy @age!</p>

In the above sample, Rythm directives are put inside the html comment, and thus the html document will not be broken

In addition, Rythm support smart natural template when you switch the context:

bc. <!-- @if (true) { -->
    <script>
        /* @if(true) {*/
            alert(1);
        /* } */
    </script><
!-- } -->

So in the above sample, the Rythm directive use @<!--@ and @-->@ as directive boundaries when running in html context, and switch to @/*@ and @*/@ when running in javascript context

Due to it impact parsing performance, the natural template feature is not enabled by default. You need set @feature.natural_template.enabled@ to true to turn on the feature when initializing Rythm engine, or just put @rythm.feature.natural_template.enabled=true@ in your play @application.conf@ file.
