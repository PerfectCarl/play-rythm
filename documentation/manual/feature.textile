h1. PlayRythm features

PlayRythm is yet another template engine plugin for Play!Framework 1.2x version:

# Static and strong typed pure Java template. Yes it's like Japid and Jamon
# Razor like syntax
# Transparently integrated with Play!Framework. Just follow what you did with Groovy template is okay, no RythmController, no rythmview. Think PlayRythm as an unobtrusive Japid.
# Support layout and tag, as you did in Groovy template
# Support FastTags and JavaExtensions with constraints
