h1. PlayRythm features

PlayRythm is yet another template engine plugin for Play!Framework 1.2x version:

# Static and strong typed pure Java template. Yes it's like Japid and Jamon
# Transparently integrated with Play!Framework. Just follow what you did with Groovy template is okay, no RythmController, no rythmview. Think PlayRythm as an unobtrusive Japid.
## Reuse your existing "Fast Tags":user_guide#play_fasttag. Many Play's built-in FastTags implemented.
## Use Play's built-in "Java Extensions":user_guide#java_extension. Support for Application Java Extensions are planned.
# Flexible tag creating
# Generic template extend
