h1. PlayRythm features

PlayRythm is yet another template engine plugin for Play!Framework 1.2x version:

# Static and strong typed pure Java template. Yes it's like Japid and Jamon. See "user's guide":user_guide.
# Transparently integrated with Play!Framework. There is no "RythmController" and no special directly layout. Think PlayRythm as an unobtrusive Japid.
# Reuse your existing "fast tags":user_guide#play_fasttag.
# Flexible tag creating
# Generic template extension
